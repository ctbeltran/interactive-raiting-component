# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In the development of this project I had the opportunity to reinforce my knowledge about the handling of the DOM. One of the main remains was to decide the correct HTML tagging for the rating buttons, in the end I decided to make them radio type inputs.


### Continued development

Even if you use inputs, for the rating do not handle the sending of the information through the submit event. In future projects I will put into practice the handling of this event.
